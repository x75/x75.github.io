### Introduction

Inspired by posting about the Jellyfishbot
(<https://twitter.com/x7557x/status/1527045770289065984>) and relating
that to sustainable development goals (SDGs), I started to think
(again) about how our own work on social robots at jetpack is related
to those goals. In particular we get the impression, that quite often
this is not at all obvious to many readers.

We see ourselves as meaningful participants in a global society. Both
as individuals and also as an organization we work for a healthy
global environment and a livable future, and nothing else. We do this
for ourselves, our children, and everyone. In due course, we align
ourselves with the Agenda 2030 which sets 17 sustainable development
goals.

> The SDGs provide worldwide guidance for addressing the global
> challenges facing the international community.

A company's impact in terms of the UN sustainable development goals
(SDG) is especially important, because it can be potentially much
larger than an individual's impact. Below we provide an annotated
selection of SDGs which aim to outline where and how flatcat engages
with one of the 17 goals listed on <https://sdgs.un.org/goals>


### SDG #3 Good health and well-being

![Good health and well-being](/assets/E-WEB-Goal-03.png){:class="img-responsive"}

Mental health and psychical well-being is part of overall health and
well-being. As embodied artifical intelligence nerds (aka 21st century
roboticists) we have studied much biology and are well informed about
the close connection of bodily and psychological parameters. One of
the reasons is that if robots are to interact in a pleasant way with
humans, they need to be aware of the needs of the human body. |

Loneliness is a social and emotional factor that contributes to
degraded well-being. This can lead to illness and shortened lives in
the long run. Thus companionship is an important experience for people
with direct influences on someone's mental state. Its mental health
related benefits include feeling a purpose, training one's social
skills, being mentally stimulated, feeling the attention of another
being, and being physically touched and spoken too.

We are using the term "robots can do pet-like things where real pets
cannot". This reflects a general aspect of our approach, to build
things onion style, aka onionicity. See
<https://twitter.com/x7557x/status/1528849524596391936>. This means,
that even while very approximately, the desired function is already
there qualitatively and then only needs to grow more perfectly into
the final requirements.

So for creating inspiring companionship, we start with
companionship-like things. For flatcat these are autonomous activity,
real time reactivity in interaction, and dependence on supervision
creating a deep level of engagement. It creates a feeling of being
seen, and of being needed, which can contribute to feeling of having
purpose.

Bodily touch through physical motion has an indirect but equally
strong effect on humans. There is strong of evidence that pleasant
touch is a real phenomenon down to its very own neural circuit
[citation needed], and an integral contributor to human
well-being. flatcat is a robot that knows how to touch. It is one of
very few robots existing, that is so sensitive that you can actually
hold into your face without any fear of getting smacked or squeezed
crudely. This is where flatcat makes another contribution, because it
can pleasantly touch you and haptically interact in a sensitive and
meaningful way. Here again, there is much more to human touch than
what flatcat can achieve, but what it does achieve is still part of
the full thing.


### SDG #4 Quality education (Open source)

![Quality education](/assets/E-WEB-Goal-04.png){:class="img-responsive"}

Education is a lot about didactics, that is, how to best *teach*
particular knowledge and skills. All of this depends largely on the
availability of adequate teaching material, and, more importantly, on
the general availability of information about how things work. Open
source technology is a revolution with respect to availability of such
functional documentation. While not always well documented in prose,
it contributes tremenduously to the education task by making
mechanisms available for reading *in principle*. With complex
technology, understanding is hard to start off with, but without a
definitive description of what is going on, anything downstream is
guesswork and reverse engineering at best.

Thus, basically any piece of functional technology being published
under an open licensing term, contributes to quality education, in
terms of hard, reliable, and reproducible facts about the workings of
any kind of complex artificial system, be it a car, a chat bot, or any
other kind of social robot.

Another huge part good teaching depends on is the availability of good
story blocks. Motivation is everything, and usually stories are the
best way to create true excitement for a field or a cause. Thus
flatcat also contributes to learning and understanding of something
complex through its ability to create playful engagement and
interaction. So it is not just about the technology behind flatcat but
also about the object itself and what it does.

The ongoing reaction and adjustment to its environment and behavioural
patterns creates the possibility for human-robot couple to invent
itself accordingly. Thus, the constant exchange of stimulation and,
arguably, knowledge through the sensory interaction between flatcat
and human and vice versa creates a learning by doing educational
approach, an example of how robots can make us learn something about
ourselves.

### SDG #5 Gender equality

![Gender equality](/assets/E-WEB-Goal-05.png){:class="img-responsive"}

Due to the unique and embracing approach of jetpack robot designs,
foremost including flatcat, using a soft fur instead of the prevailing
and arguably inapproachable glossy plastic hard shell so often seen,
unusual accessibility is created, in particular with respect to
gender-based perceptual boundaries. There is a long-term impact in
this on making STEM topics interesting and thus relevant for a more
diverse crowd beyond the usual suspect male tech nerd gangstas, that
seems to be over-abundantly driving the pertaining design community. |

### SDG #9 Industry, innovation, and infrastructure

![Industry, innovation, and infrastructure](/assets/E-WEB-Goal-09.png){:class="img-responsive"}

flatcat is a hardware product. With this, it brings industrial
manufacturing to the forefront. With a humble batch size of 20 we are
already showing, how industrial parameters like supply chain
reliability are impacting product cost and availability.

Our business model is that of gaming consoles. As it goes, consoles
are the hardware substrate that needs to be brought out in order for
any kind of aftermarket revenue to be had by selling apps, add-ons and
other kind of merchandise. Obviously, this creates the infrastructure
for both creating customer value as well as technologically
sustainable innovation.

The last bit, innovation, is the crucial bit. flatcat is indeed a
highly innovative piece of technology, with unprecedented skills and
capabilities in the direct interaction of a robot with humans. Force
competence will be adressed by breakthrough robotics products
necessarily, due to the importance of this modality for the experience
of being human. Wouldn't you prefer a good experience over an awkward
one?


### SDG #11 Sustainable cities and communities

![Sustainable cities and communities](/assets/E-WEB-Goal-11.png){:class="img-responsive"}

Urbanisation is one of the major phenomena of the 20th century and
extending critically into the 21st one. The massive condensation of
people in increasingly large cities and urban areas poses quite
particular challenges, especially to health and well-being. Social
aspects are also a big part of that because humans are social animals
and their health depends on meaningful belonging. Loneliness as a lack
of appropriate social interaction leads to degrading health and
illness in the long run.


### SDG #12 Responsible consumption and production

![Responsible consumption and production](/assets/E-WEB-Goal-12.png){:class="img-responsive"}

We like to go forward with practical examples of how open source,
contemporary ethics, and ecological thinking can be employed in
high-tech robot cultural production. This goes for scale of
production, materials used, and the effective placement of the robot
in a larger cultural frame. Open source technology is a prerequisite
for repairabiity, which again is a prerequisite for sustainable
quality hardware products that are ready for an uncertain future,
which, above all the uncertainty, it certainly is. flatcat is fully
repairable through the availability of its contruction plan, the use
of 3D-printed parts which can be recreated at home or somewhere
nearby, regardless of where in the world you are. Parts are made from
biodegradable material, locally manufactured and sourced where
possible.

### Summary

Motivated by a related recent post, we set out to discuss and annotate
how social robots and our own robot design of flatcat is related to
sustainable development in the 21st century. The main points of
connection are contributions to health and well-being, and
education. Through a strong interconnection among the individual
goals, there is additional aspects which we highlighted across
more technological, social, and ecological SDGs.
