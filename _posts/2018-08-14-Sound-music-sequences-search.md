### Sound, music, sequences, search

__Keywords__: sound, music, computer music, algorithms, generative models, sequence models

This turned out the quickest way to get it done, a graphical dump of
my current picture related to the relationship of sound, music,
sequences and search, based on a shared modelling approach; incomplete
but more or less consistent [claim]. Domain layer in black, modelling
layer in green.

Would like to argue that by combining *coding*, *latent space state
propagation*, and *hierarchical composition*, most of the phenomena in
sound, music, vocalization, spoken language, and written language can
be modelled, all with the *same few items*. Let me know if you think,
that this is obvious. Taking language as variable length sequences of
actions, this can be extended straightforwardly to model navigation
problems.
