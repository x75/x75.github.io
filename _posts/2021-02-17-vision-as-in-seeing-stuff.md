### Vision as in seeing, looking with the eyes

Five keys resources like books and possibly some more in the future,
created by other people. How does vision work? It works in an awesome
and totally unintuitive way. The way vision really works is not
completely accessible from the introspective experience.

**classic**, What the Frog's Eye Tells the Frog's Brain, Lettvin et al., 1959, <https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4065609>

**compensation is not enough**, Why red doesn't sound like a bell, Kevin O'Regan, 2011, <http://nivea.psycho.univ-paris5.fr/>

**very good**, The eye and the brain, Richard Gregory, 1966, <https://press.princeton.edu/books/paperback/9780691165165/eye-and-brain>

Vision, David Marr

Perception of the visual world, James Gibson, 1950, ...
