### Blockchain and NFTs


everyone knows about energy use in blockchain and more recently
NFTs. i would like to emphasize another point in case, deep neural
networks and large scale state of the art machine learning models. a
single training run of GPT-2 model produces 90kg CO2 emission
equivalent, a fully tuned and optimized model involves many single
runs and in summary produces 500000kg of CO2 equivalent. the
performance of these models is good, but we may ask about the cost at
any time.
