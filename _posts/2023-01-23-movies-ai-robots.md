## Movies about AI and robots

Robots without AI are just dumb machines, so quite logically robots
that appear in sci-fi stories are strongly connected to AI. Here is an
*incomplete* list of such movies which I found noteworthy in a good or
bad way. I am sure I forgot some obvious ones but there will still be
plenty of more obscure ones. Either way I am happy to have your
remarks and pointers in the comments or messages.

I will start with a list featuring *androids*, which are
robots that are not only humanoid but effectively so well-made that
they are indistinguishable from real humans. The second list is with
robots of any kind, the third one is about related movies featuring
some kind cyborg or otherwise hybrid human-artificial intelligent
beings. Adding a forth one which I think is also related about (it is
all a) simulation hypothesis.

### Movies with androids

 - Blade Runner (classic), a major topic of Blade Runner actually is the difficulty of distinguishing androids and humans. I thought Blade Runner 2 was quite good as well.
 - Real humans (Swedish original, 2012), <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_Humans>
 - Ich bin dein Mensch (I'm your Man) 2021, <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I%27m_Your_Man_(2021_film)>
 - A.I. - Artificial Intelligence, 2001, <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A.I._Artificial_Intelligence>
 - Eva, 2011 <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eva_(2011_film)>
 - Love, death and robots, EP14S1, Zima Blue, <https://lovedeathrobots.fandom.com/wiki/Zima_Blue>
 
#### Unwatched
 - Westworld (both original and series), <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Westworld_(film)>, <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Westworld_(TV_series)>
 
### Other robot or AI movies

 - Chappie (CHAPPiE), 2015, by Neill Blomkamp, very nice and plausible story about an actual developmental robot in the wild, <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chappie_(film)>
 - Ex machina, 2014, <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ex_Machina_(film)>
 - Hitchhiker's guide to the Galaxy (robot Marvin)
 - Final space (robot KVN, among others)
 - Her, 2013, by Spike Jonze, Man falls in love with chatbot, had to stop watching in the middle because it felt awkward, <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Her_(film)>
 - Nummer f√ºnf lebt (classic)
 - Wall-E

#### Unwatched
 - Hi, Ai - Liebesgeschichten aus der Zukunft (hi ai, documentary, bwo udk 111) <https://www.imdb.com/title/tt9081788/>
 - Brian and Charles, 2022, <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian_and_Charles>

### Not directly AI but highly related, brain interfacing and mind upload

 - Ghost in the Shell (1995 original), more a cyborg tale, <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghost_in_the_Shell_(1995_film)>
 - Paprika, 2006, <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paprika_(2006_film)>
 - Pantheon, series, <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pantheon_(TV_series)>, GitS reference included.

### Simulation hypothesis

 - Welt am Draht (World on a Wire), 1972, Fassbinder, Two part TV show, great style and mood. Story by Daniel F. Galoye, 1964, Simulacron-3, <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simulacron-3>
 - The thirtenth floor, remake of Welt am Draht / re-adaptation of Simulacron-3
 - Matrix trilogy, for completeness
