## Movies about AI and robots

Robots without AI are just dumb machines, so quite logically robots
that appear in sci-fi stories are strongly connected to AI. Here is an
*incomplete* list of such movies which I found noteworthy in a good or
bad way. I am sure I forgot some obvious ones but there will still be
plenty of more obscure ones. Either way I am happy to have your
remarks and pointers in the comments or messages.

I will start with a list featuring *androids*, which are
robots that are not only humanoid but effectively so well-made that
they are indistinguishable from real humans. The second list is with
robots of any kind, the third one is about related movies featuring
some kind cyborg or otherwise hybrid human-artificial intelligent
beings. Adding a forth one which I think is also related about (it is
all a) simulation hypothesis.

### Movies with androids

 - Blade Runner (classic), a major topic of Blade Runner actually is the difficulty of distinguishing androids and humans. I thought Blade Runner 2 was quite good as well.
 - Real humans (Swedish original, 2012), <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_Humans>
 - Ich bin dein Mensch (I'm your Man) 2021, <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I%27m_Your_Man_(2021_film)>

### Other robot or AI movies

### Simulation hypothesis

 - The thirtenth floor, remake of Welt am Draht / re-adaptation of Simulacron-3
 - Matrix trilogy, for completeness

 - Under the skin, 2013, <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Under_the_Skin_(2013_film)>, bwo Luke Harby
 - Terminator 1,2,3, including the time travel this is close to an alien robot
