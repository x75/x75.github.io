## A review of A thousand brains by Jeff Hawkins

![This is an image](/assets/Hawkins-A-thousand-brains-1K.png)

Brains and nervous systems are the most exciting and truly weird
topics to discover.

They can be approached through neuroscience, ethology, psychology,
cognitive science, arts, brain-inspired computing, and bio-inspired
robotics.

Or, even in some other ways. Easy, because our own brain and CNS is
involved in all our perception and acquisition of knowledge. It is
involved in everything we are and do. It is us, and it is bodily
(somatic) al the way down. This is called embodiment.

If the 20th century has seen the emergence of non-classical theory in
physics, it has also seen the beginnings of non-classical theory in,
ultimately, biology. Biology as the basis and substrate of the
majority of intelligent behavior we are observing, anywhere.

Anyway, bla bla. Just finished reading "A thousand brains" by [Jeff
Hawkins](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeff_Hawkins), who you might know from [Numenta](https://numenta.com), their
papers, or from the earlier book "A new kind of intelligence", which I
haven't read.

The work presented and discussed in the book is about the human
neocortex, its computational mechanics, and its principles of
organization.

What the brain does, in general, is to create models of the world,
which it then uses to make predictions and find ways (sequences of
actions) to get to goals (usually related to survival, in the broad
sense of the complicated life's of contemporary humans). This is
called **inverting** a model.

In the book, the idea that these internal models don't come in
singular, but rather in a massively large bundle, a huge flock of
models, is expounded and illustrated in clear and fun prose, including
some pictures.

One of the weirdest things about the brain is the modelling
decomposition. Sorry. I just love that word so much.

What is decomposition? I don't mean the degenerative one. It is meant
in the mathematical sense of decomposing something complex into a set
of simpler things, together with an explanation of their interactions,
so that the overall story will yield the original phenomenon.

Most of us will have an acquired and consciously accessible
decomposition of the world in our heads, called a mindset. Usually
that's objects, persons, domains; interactions come via force and
gravity, light, sound and touch, inner focus and sociality, etc;

So the cool thing that the brain does, is a) to decompose the world
into a soup of models, and b), that this decomposition is mostly and
unconsciously completely different and utterly alien to our own
introspective thinking. It just doesn't align. No, it doesn't. The
objects of conscious introspective thought are just the tip of the
iceberg, of all unconscious mental and neural activity, not available
to introspection.

One of the reasons that this is so is somatics, properties of a
physical body that needs to compute in a physical universe, governed
by energy equations, metabolics, and distribution networks. Limitation
as a resource. Work that.

The story of the relationship between the subjective introspection
experience of feeling and living, and objective neural mechanics is
one of the most pressing issues in science communication.

Why? Because understanding our own behavior and decision mechanics is
essential for our civilization to survive the 21st century. Period.

Hawkins' book throws a lot of stepping stones out into our path
through a foggy toxic lava swamp. Highly appreciated and recommended.
