### Goals and carrots [WIP]

On reflection, it currently appears to me, that the source of my
motivation is *beauty* which comes quite close to something like
*meaning*. In mathematics, beauty has long been identified as a
lighthouse guiding search in high-dimensional darkness. Then meaning
is something that beauty can acquire by being applied in the real
world for its own sake.

It is straightforward to identify a number major challenges that all
of us humans are facing on a global level, with all of us in it
together in a joint future. These challenges are of ecological,
social, and economic nature and are characterized throughout by
*complexity*, a thing which we are just able to identify, and just
beginning to understand and take serious, although with a long history
of ideas attached (Refs: Gell-Mann: The Quark and the Jaguar, ). This
understanding should be available on a collective level to inform
policy making. Policies are recipes for action put down in a
table. Each situation that can be encountered should have a line in
the table and the corresponding entry in that line tells you what to
do in this situation. Sound knowledge of policy making should be
available at all levels of human activity, starting from individuals,
out through families, organizations, communities, regions, countries,
up to planetary scope.

Ignoring complexity issues usually leads to any of a wide array of
possible fails with quite variable impact (Refs: Clausewitz: the
essential unpredictability of war, the fog of war, "friction" – the
disparity between the ideal performance of units, organisation or
systems and their actual performance in real world scenarios (Book I,
Chapter VII), Dörner, 1997: The Logic Of Failure: Recognizing And
Avoiding Error In Complex Situations; Taleb, 2008: The Impact of the
Highly Improbable; Trivers, 2011, Deceit and self-deception: Fooling
yourself the better to fool others; tbc). Classic examples include the
release of rabbits in australia, the Cobra effect, and so on. Apart
from particular technical approaches to immediate concerns,
e.g. automated driving, education, elderly care, environmental
cleaning jobs, and so on, AI surely has cooperative potential for
augmenting human capacity and provide systematic contribution to
policy making at all relevant levels of small, medium, and large,
e.g. the individual, communal, regional and global levels.

We would like to contribute to peeling out the cooperative and
augmenting aspects. As a team we are facing several complex problems,
for example the self-management of a geographically distributed
team. Since this is a really big one, it cannot be expected to be
"solved" anywhere soon, so it's necessary to default to effective
heuristics and some glue to build approximate solution. I will start
by listing and briefly describing some heuristics that appear
promising to me, touching on the following items: open culture,
transparency, empowerment, local autonomy, self responsibility,
attention, credibility, past / future horizons, variability, local
minima, optimality in non-stationary environments.

The first one is openness. In my experience, this is of fundamental
importance and I have become a proponent of radical openness, but I am
aware that the appeal is not always intuitive.

The basic argument is about the cost of closedness (see also and
expand: hidden cost, true cost). This cost is just not considered in
closed approaches, which clearly is negligent and careless. We have to
be aware that we are working with knowledge, and the beginning of
knowledge are ideas. Ideas are not isolated, standalone entities but
have to be considered on an ecological level. They are born and live
in an ecosystem of knowledge and ideas, and critically depend on each
other. The classical quote about "standing on the shoulders of giants"
<sup><a id="fnr.1" class="footref" href="#fn.1">1</a></sup> is just
about that. This means, we depend on access to ideas of others, and
fostering the ideas of others depends on sharing your own ideas. The
actual success of any particular enterprise hinges on a few very small
detailed modifications on knowledge widely available to everyone else
(FIXME: history of innovation with examples).

> good, you'll have to ram them down people's throats. &#x2013; Howard
> Aiken <sup><a id="fnr.2" class="footref" href="#fn.2">2</a></sup>

This is fully coherent with my own experience, allowing the vanity of
having had at least one good idea at some point. Keeping things closed
and proprietary thus incurs large cost. There is the immediate cost of
securing access to code and documents, the cost of complicating
publishing and deployment, and the longer term cost of impeding
evaluation and weeding out of bad ideas through discourse with
others. In the end, "closing" things in a complex world is impossible,
and basically it amounts to "obscuring" things. Then we know, security
by obscurity does not work in the long run.

Reinterpreting security as a kind of robustness to "attack", a good
heuristic can be gleaned from biology.
