# Hierarchical self-organization summary

E.F. Schumacher, Small is beautiful, Part 4, Chapter 16: Towards a Theory of Large-Scale Organisation

> Order / chaos balance
> 
> Five principles: 1/ principle of subsidiarity, 2/ principle of vindication, 3/ principle of identification (no confounding, local accountability), 4/ principle of motivation, 5/ principle of the middle axiom.

The fundamental task is to achieve smallness within large organisation.

Balance orderliness and creative chaos, need both of them, always.

The five principles in more detail


## 1 The Principle of Subsidiarity or The Principle of Subsidiary Function

(local autonomy)

The higher level must not absorb the functions of the lower one, on
the assumption that, being higher, it will automatically be wiser and
fulfil them more efficiently. Loyalty can grow only from the smaller
units to the larger (and higher) ones, not the other way round - and
loyalty is an essential element in She health of any organisation.


## 2 The Principle of Vindication

(no-single-best-average and respect-the-outliers, support-the-living-artist, social-contract-explorers-we)

To vindicate means: to defend against reproach or accusation: to prove
to be true and valid; to justify; to uphold; so this principle
describes very well one of the most important duties of the central
authority towards the lower formations. Good government is always
government by exception.  Except for exceptional cases, the subsidiary
unit must be defended against reproach and upheld. This means that the
exception must be sufficiently clearly defined, so that the quasi-firm
is able to know without doubt whether or not it is performing
satisfactorily.


## 3 The Principle of Identification

(self-accountability, closing-the-information-loop-on-self-actions)

Each subsidiary unit or quasi-firm must have both a profit and loss
account and a balance sheet. From the point of view of orderliness a
profit and loss statement is quite sufficient, since from this one can
know whether or not the unit is contributing financially to the
organisation. But for the entrepreneur, a balance sheet is essential,
even if it is used only for internal purposes.


## 4 The Principle of Motivation

(motivation is everything, self-motivation, self-story, lawful/meaningful, ikigai)

It is a trite and obvious truism that people act in accordance with
their motives. All the same, for a large organisation, with its
bureaucracies, its remote and impersonal controls, its many abstract
rules and regulations, and above all the relative incomprehensibility
that stems from its very size, motivation is the central problem. At
the top, the management has no problem of motivation, but going down
the scale, the problem becomes increasingly acute, This is not the
place to go into the details of this vast and difficult subject.


## 5 The Principle of the Middle Axiom

(decentralization, local-autonomy, local-knowledge, exception-friendliness)

Top management in a large organisation inevitably occupies a very
difficult position. It carries responsibility for everything that
happens, or fails to happen, throughout the organisation, although it
is far removed from the actual scene of events. It can deal with many
well-established functions by means of directives, rules and
regulations. But what about new developments, new creative ideas? What
about progress, the entrepreneurial activity par excellence?

We come back to our starting point: all real human problems arise from
the antinomy of order and freedom, Antinomy means a contradiction
between two laws; a conflict of authority: opposition between laws or
principles that appear to be founded equally in reason.

The centre can easily look after order; it is not so easy to look
after freedom and creativity.

What is required is something in between a middle axiom, an order from
above which is yet not quite an

Example 1: UK coal board: issue updated and small set of rules /
self-questions to go through before starting a new project. why do you
do it the way you do? did you check for A and B.

Example 2: impact statistic / action consequences

Another middle axiom can be found in the device of Impact Statistics.
Normally, statistics are collected for the benefit of the collector,
who needs -or thinks he needs - certain quantitative
information. Impact statistics have a different purpose, namely to
make the supplier of the statistic, a responsible person at the lower
formation, aware of certain facts which he might otherwise over-
look. This device has been successfully used in the coal industry,
particularly in the field of safety.
