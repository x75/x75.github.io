**2022-04-02** Updating this list by way of updating my cv, adding most recent releases and adding more direct links.

**2021-01-17** Update from another thread, over the years I have
accumulated so many aliases that I lost track myself. Still picking up
the threads, there is progress though.

**2020-12-25** Coming back to this after two years since writing the
first draft I remember the original motivation. I needed to get an
overview on all published music I authored to get the royalties
sorted. Project **backward** and the **availability** directive sprang
from this.

### Catalogue story

#### plazma

Not showing specific musical talent during childhood, Oswald's
creative audio life starts at age 6 or so with the production of
nonsense podcasts together with his brother *ub* using a microphone
and the tape recorder of their parents' stereo. Later on, playing the
guitar had to be learned to fulfil on a band founded earlier with the
homies klaus, grt, and tomi. After some changes in setup and name, the
band was *plazma*, a unique outfit by any measure. *plazma* produced
two full-length albums and seven tons of session recordings. All
self-produced at low budget, practicing creative engineering and
effective self-organization. Both albums were self-published on tape
in 1993 and 1994 as limited tape editions.

**Update 2020-12-25**: 𝗻𝗲𝗿𝘃𝗲𝗰𝗵𝗼𝗿𝗱𝘀 by plazma, album digital reissue released 2020 on farmersmanual - [generate and test](https://farmersmanual.bandcamp.com/album/nervechords) - gt29

#### cd\_slopper

Working together with [Florian Hecker](http://florianhecker.blogspot.com/) we came up with
[cd\_slopper](https://www.discogs.com/artist/11328-CD_slopper) thinking it to be a
good name for our joint activity. At the time we were deep in
exploring codecs and manipulating audio on the level of non-PCM
codecs. The frame structure used in MP3 is aesthetically very close to
grain based synthesis. This became an interesting set of relations to
sample from and work with.

**2020-12-25**: frame slopping, grains / pulsarets, codec frame
synthesis

#### fals.ch

Shortly after work on cd\_slopper was started, we built a new version
of the MEGO sublabel falsch and launched it under the
[fals.ch](https://fals.ch) domain, heroically conserved by the
@internetarchive on [fals.ch
archive](https://web.archive.org/web/19991218005216/http://fals.ch). The
idea was to be a digital content provider (aka netlabel), build a
random but unique self-referential and novel digital style, and
implement the organization of the label as a digital process
itself. Curiosly, the first version of the website was written in perl
using Ted Nelson's ZigZag(tm) structure as a backend database and
custom frontend code. In the second iteration, a LAMP implementation
of a similar mechanism was used, getting up to speed with developing
web technologies. It allowed online manipulation by editors directly
via the website, CMS and so, uuh!

All of this proved to be creatively fruitful and a lot of fun.
Economically it was not even unsuccessful due to our outright
art-pour-l'art approach, aka business naivity, but did not carry. The
label released about 50 packages of cutting edge audio-visual content
by an illustre set of both acclaimed and upcoming artists, united by
the their quest for truly innovative approach in media design,
technical and aesthetic identity. The discography includes two
tangible physical releases, each a CDROM sampling the catalogue at 25
(fb25) and 50 (fb50) releases.

fals.ch has been successfully reanimated from cryo sleep in or
about 2019. the domain is live again and points to a reconstruction of
the back catalogue. new release scheduled and upcoming.

#### Gullibloon

Picking up fm's obsession with sonification and real time data-driven
synthesis and composition approaches, Gullibloon was conceived as a
double identity of software project and music author, building all of
their pieces on real time data feeds collected from virtual and
physical sources. Tapping processes such as network traffic, computer
activity status, various sensors and algorithmic generators. They can
be found on the [web](https://gullibloon.org).

- Gullibloon 'MUH' (ALKU 87, 2010), Music cassette tape, grey and pink versions, sold out, <http://alkualkualkualkualkualkualkualkualkualku.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ALKU87>
- Army of Darkness, on [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7nEPDXEioM&t=28s), produced ca. 2010

#### Solo work

Been creating an amount of synthetic persona over time that makes
myself dizzy at times. These persona including *Calimba de Luna*,
*dprmkr*, *pxp* and *tsx*, to name just a few. They are all listed in
the musicography table at the beginning of this page.

Here is a clipping from the [Chicago
Reader](https://chicagoreader.com/arts-culture/oswald-berthold/) by
Peter Margasak from 27 Nov, 2003 published in the run-up to the first
and so far only live appearance of *pxp*

> There are few practitioners of electronic music more challenging than the Austrian group Farmers Manual. Their music draws on the vocabulary of club music–pulsating bass lines, frantic drum ‘n’ bass and techno beats, modem handshakes and digital glitches–but embeds these elements in a new and alien grammar. Their long, apparently improvised streams of digitalia are at times grating and self-indulgent, but at its best their work is densely layered with arresting details and packed with abrupt and exciting shifts in texture and rhythm. They recently issued a mind-boggling DVD-ROM entitled RLA (Mego; it stands for “recent live archive”) containing more than 70 hours of audio produced at performances and gallery installations since 1995. The additional 70 minutes of electronic abstraction on While(p)”print”.”,” “x$p++” (Wavetrap), a recent solo album by group member Oswald Berthold (working as PXP), are by turns harsh and serene, viscous and brittle. For his Chicago debut, Berthold will present a new piece called “Tats=3D94chliche-Chaos,” which depends in part on what he calls “distributed online automated entities” that kidnap random packets of data from the Internet and turn them into sound–working, according to Berthold, “like virtual players in a virtual little band.” There will be a visual component to the performance as the same data is simultaneously translated into pixelated animations. Berthold’s work strains the conventional definition of music to the breaking point, but between the range of the sounds he creates and the mystery of the underlying methodology, there’s plenty here to sink your teeth into. Saturday, November 29, 9 PM, 6Odum, 2116 W. Chicago; 773-227-3617 or 312-666-0795.
