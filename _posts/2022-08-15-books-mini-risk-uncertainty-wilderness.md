## Review of three books all in one

After reading Gigerenzer's Risksavvy I started out doing a meta-review of five books I've had on decision making and risk management. Yukkes, topic proved too sticky and I got stuck. To break the stuckness, and new books were coming in waiting to be reviewed, I decided to go for a five-sentences-for-each-book approach. Here we go, on average more than five sentences but within reasonable bounds. Hope you enjoy, all three recommended.

### Book review: Risiko by Gerd Gigerenzer

A recommendation by rakso2

Risiko, aka risksavvy as the original English title, by Gerd Gigerenzer is a book about decision making.

The decisions we make every day a number of times are usually connected with uncertainty, and thus risk.

Take the later train and not waste time or take the earlier train and leave some maneuvering space to still take a cab, if the train is delayed or cancelled, Berlin example.

Essentially we are making decisions in face of three types of uncertainty scenarios: certainty, risk (known uncertainty), total uncertainty. TODO insert page pic.

Risksavvy makes a clear voice for the use of heuristics, in face of the last of these three scenarios, in favor over optimization and a purely rational stance as taken by Kahneman.

I met Gerd Gigerenzer earlier this year and we discussed decisions, flatcat, and his new book.

The definition of a startup by Eric Ries is "an institution to develop a product under circumstances of extreme uncertainty."

The book is very well written, sits on a sound body of quantitative results and reasoning, and is loaded with incredible stories from pension plans, health care, and more. I read the German edition but trust in the translation.

In additional Gigerenzer launches the clear idea of putting the relevant subjects (statistics, psychology) into primary school curricula, which I fully support. TODO expound.

### Book review: Surfing uncertainty by Andy Clark

![Surfing uncertainty (ebook) by Andy Clark](/assets/clark-uncertainty.jpg){:class="img-responsive"}

A recommendation by [Guido Schillaci](http://www.guidoschillaci.eu/) a Roboticist and AI reseacher

[Andy Clark](https://profiles.sussex.ac.uk/p493-andy-clark) is a prolific advocate of the *radically* predictive view of brain function, the predictive brain hypothesis.

The work revolves around expounding the implications of the predictive view of the organization of neuronal activity, as exemplified by the publications of Friston and colleagues.

While alternatively called the free energy principle of brain organization or the active inference principle, or yet something else, this view is the first to make a categorical difference by flipping the whole idea of behavior from the stimulus-response principle over to the prediction-error principle.

That means that animals are not driven by the stimuli coming in from the environment whereupon they are free to choose a response. Rather, they are actively seeking out stimuli through their actions and shaping their experience just a tad ahead of the passive flow of things.

> Do you realize what this means?!!

This image has of course huge implications for the design of robots, if not interpreting human actions and experience in a better way, especially for agents that are designed to surf on new situations they never before experienced, through the use of exploration (trying stuff out) and learning (sorting into what worked and what didn't).

It means that every single piece of data counts starting from the beginning of learning in order to try out the most informative thing next at any given time.

> Plus all the hierarchical stuff you need to check out on your own <3

There is plenty of other implications and welcome simplifications within the nascent theory of adaptive behavior which makes this view so essential.

The book is awesomly written, although it took me a bit to lock onto the groove and that did pay off, it focusses on the predictive processing formulation within the set of available formulations, and comprehensively explores all corners through many angles making using of plenty well-chosen examples, often visually presented. Super-recommended.

### Book review: Braving the wilderness by Brené Brown

![Braving the wilderness (ebook) by Brené Brown](/assets/brown-wilderness.jpg){:class="img-responsive"}

A recommendation by [Marjan Sharifi](https://www.marjansharifi.com)

Brené Brown is a researcher, storyteller, and (currently enraged) Texan who’s spent the past two decades studying courage, vulnerability, shame, and empathy.

After checking out her work, aeh, [website](https://brenebrown.com/), the book "Braving the Wilderness - The Quest for True Belonging and the Courage to Stand Alone" spoke to me with the stand alone bit, so I dived right in.

The story and book are great, while it took me a bit to accept some of the context, but hey. That's why we are here.

It is about belonging, how a sense of belonging is necessary for the health of a human being, and what happens if you end up, like many of us, without a clear sense of belonging to any specific group, clientele, off-the-shelf identity, thing, or what have you.

An alternative, exemplified through the quote by Maya Angelou, "You are only free when you realize you belong no place—you belong every place—no place at all. The price is high. The reward is great.", the story takes us through the quest of finding belonging to yourself, from where everything of true signficance starts.

The place where we need to go, stand, and generally hang out is called the wilderness. Going out there, being vulnerable, and showing yourself.

The proposal is to use the concept sequence of BRAVING: Boundaries, Reliability, Accountability, Vault, Integrity, Nonjudgment, Generosity.

Another set of four piece rule, even more practical, goes like 1. People Are Hard to Hate Close Up. Move In. 2. Speak Truth to Bullshit. Be Civil. 3. Hold Hands. With Strangers. 4. Strong Back. Soft Front. Wild Heart.

These things are explained in the book of course in more detail, also with vivid examples. I think that the wording is well chosen though, and the terms speak for themselves and thus can be quoted and used just so to reasonable effect. Recommended.

TIL: bullshit
