#### Humboldt beginnings and plazma

Not showing specific musical talent during childhood, Oswald's musical
career starts at age 6 or so, with the production of nonsense radio
plays together with his brother *ub* using the tape-based recording
functions of their parents' stereo. Later on, playing the guitar had
to be learned, to be able to found a band together with homies Klaus,
grt, Tomi, Mitch and Hannah. After a few transformations, this band
became *plazma* which was a unique outfit within the ecosystem of
teenager-run bands in the city of Graz, Austria, at that time. plazma
has two albums, both self-produced at ultra-low budget, using advanced
track-bouncing techniques and countryside creativity retreats. Both
also, unfortunately unreleased to date, but #wip.

Separate story to be filled in at another time, until then find more
info on [bandcamp](https://farmersmanual.bandcamp.com/),
[discogs](https://www.discogs.com/artist/356-Farmers-Manual),
[wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Farmers_Manual), and their
[website](http://web.fm) or the [recent live
archive](http://rla.web.fm) or the [internet
archive](https://archive.org/search.php?query=farmersmanual).

#### cd_slopper

Working together with Florian Hecker we soon thought `cd_slopper` to
be a good name for our activity. At the time we were deep in exploring
codecs and manipulating audio on the level of non-PCM codecs. The
frame structure used in MP3 is aesthetically very close to grain based
synthesis. This became an interesting set of relations to sample from.

#### fals.ch

At about the same time that work on cd_slopper was started, we built a
new version of Mego's sublabel falsch. The idea was to be an digital
content provider (netlabel), build a random but unique
self-referential and novel digital style, and implement the
organization as a digital process itself. Curiosly, the backend of the
first version of the website was Andrew Pam's (?, check) perl
implementation of Ted Nelson's ZigZag(tm) using custom frontend
code. In the second iteration, a custom implementation of a similar
mechanism was used, making it easier to benefit from existing web
technologies and allowing online editing of the label's datastore,
directly via the website. All of this proved to be creatively fruitful
and a lot of fun, although economically unsuccessful due to our
outright art-pour-l'art approach, aka business naivity. The label
released more than 50 packages of digital audio-visual content by a
diverse set of upcoming and acclaimed artists, united by the their
quest for truly innovative approaches to media design of technical and
aesthetic excellence. The releases include two tangible CDROMs serving
as cross-sections of the catalogue.

#### gullibloon

Picking up fm's sonification and real time data-driven synthesis and
composition approach, gullibloon was conceived as both software vendor
and musical identity, building all of their pieces on data feeds
collected from virtual and physical source processes such as network
traffic, computer activity status, various sensors and algorithmic
generators. They can be found on the [web](https://gullibloon.org).

 - Gullibloon 'MUH' (ALKU 87, 2010), Music cassette tape, grey and pink versions, sold out, <http://alkualkualkualkualkualkualkualkualkualku.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ALKU87>
 - army of darkness, on [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7nEPDXEioM&t=28s), produced ca. 2010 (?)

#### Solo work

Been building several different identities over time, starting with
wrzk and *pxp* and *tsx* later on.

 - pxp - while (wavetrap, 2002)
 - pxp - nada (rekorder, 2005)
 - Various - Rara avis, ALKU, 2017?
 - tsx - recur (trust, 2017), available via TRUST Vienna on
   [bandcamp](https://trust.bandcamp.com/album/recur) or on youtube
   ([going](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6gjx773udo),
   [squrp](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSqJ-OmqtDA),
   [slow](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MyBKmX7xpA), [brum brum
   like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oEtSrK6kbO4)).
