#### Humboldt beginnings and plazma

Not showing specific musical talent during childhood, Oswald's musical career starts at age 6 or so, with the production of nonsense radio plays together with his brother *ub* using the tape-based recording functions of their parents' stereo. Later on, playing the guitar had to be learned, to be able to found a band together with homies Klaus, grt, Tomi, Mitch and Hannah. After a few transformations, this band became *plazma* which was a unique outfit within the ecosystem of teenage bands in the city of Graz, Austria, at that time. plazma has two albums, both self-produced at ultra-low budget, using advanced track-bouncing techniques and countryside creativity retreats. Both also, unfortunately unreleased to date, but \#wip.

**Update**: plazma's debut album self-published on music cassette (MC) in 1994 is available digitally for the first time ever on [plazma's bandcamp](https://plazmagraz.bandcamp.com/releases).

#### farmersmanual

Separate story to be filled in at another time, until then find more info on [bandcamp](https://farmersmanual.bandcamp.com/), [discogs](https://www.discogs.com/artist/356-Farmers-Manual), [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Farmers_Manual), and their [website](http://web.fm) or the [recent live archive](http://rla.web.fm) or the [internet archive](https://archive.org/search.php?query=farmersmanual).

#### cd\_slopper

Working together with [Florian Hecker](http://florianhecker.blogspot.com/) we soon thought [cd\_slopper](https://www.discogs.com/artist/11328-CD_slopper) to be a good name for our activity. At the time we were deep in exploring codecs and manipulating audio on the level of non-PCM codecs. The frame structure used in MP3 is aesthetically very close to grain based synthesis. This became an interesting set of relations to sample from.

#### fals.ch

At about the same time that work on cd\_slopper was started, we built a new version of Mego's sublabel falsch on [fals.ch](https://web.archive.org/web/19991218005216/http://fals.ch). The idea was to be a digital content provider (aka netlabel), build a random but unique self-referential and novel digital style, and implement the organization as a digital process itself. Curiosly, the backend of the first version of the website was Andrew Pam's (?, check) perl implementation of Ted Nelson's ZigZag(tm) using custom frontend code. In the second iteration, a custom implementation of a similar mechanism was used, making it easier to benefit from existing web technologies and allowing online editing of the label's datastore, directly via the website. All of this proved to be creatively fruitful and a lot of fun, although economically unsuccessful due to our outright art-pour-l'art approach, aka business naivity. The label released more than 50 packages of digital audio-visual content by a diverse set of upcoming and acclaimed artists, united by the their quest for truly innovative approaches to media design of technical and aesthetic excellence. The releases include two tangible CDROMs serving as cross-sections of the catalogue.

#### gullibloon

Picking up fm's sonification and real time data-driven synthesis and composition approach, gullibloon was conceived as both software vendor and musical identity, building all of their pieces on data feeds collected from virtual and physical source processes such as network traffic, computer activity status, various sensors and algorithmic generators. They can be found on the [web](https://gullibloon.org).

-   Gullibloon 'MUH' (ALKU 87, 2010), Music cassette tape, grey and pink versions, sold out, <http://alkualkualkualkualkualkualkualkualkualku.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ALKU87>
-   army of darkness, on [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7nEPDXEioM&t=28s), produced ca. 2010 (?)
