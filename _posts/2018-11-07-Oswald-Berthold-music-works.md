### Catalogue story

#### Humboldt beginnings and plazma

Not showing specific musical talent during childhood, Oswald's
creative audio life starts at age 6 or so with the production of
nonsense podcasts together with his brother *ub* using a microphone
and the tape recorder of their parents' stereo. Later on, playing the
guitar had to be learned to fulfil on a band founded earlier with the
homies Klaus, grt, Tomi. After some changes in people in name, the
band was *plazma*, a unique outfit by any measure. plazma had two
albums and seven tons of session recordings. all self-produced at low
budget, practicing creative engineering and effective
self-organization. Both albums were self-published on tape in 1993 and
1994 in a limited edition.

**Update 2020-12-25**: ùóªùó≤ùóøùòÉùó≤ùó∞ùóµùóºùóøùó±ùòÄ by plazma, album digital reissue
released 2020 on farmersmanual - [generate and
test](https://farmersmanual.bandcamp.com/album/nervechords) - gt29.

Separate story to be filled in at another time. In the meantime please

etc. Please write in at any time and leave a like or a comment.

#### cd\_slopper

Working together with [Florian Hecker](http://florianhecker.blogspot.com/) we came up with
[cd\_slopper](https://www.discogs.com/artist/11328-CD_slopper) thinking it to be a
good name for our joint activity. At the time we were deep in
exploring codecs and manipulating audio on the level of non-PCM
codecs. The frame structure used in MP3 is aesthetically very close to
grain based synthesis. This became an interesting set of relations to
sample from and work with.

**2020-12-25**: frame slopping, grains / pulsarets, codec frame
synthesis

#### fals.ch

Shortly after work on cd\_slopper was started, we built a new version
of the MEGO sublabel falsch and launched it under the
[fals.ch](https://fals.ch) domain, heroically conserved by the
@internetarchive on [fals.ch
archive](https://web.archive.org/web/19991218005216/http://fals.ch). The
idea was to be a digital content provider (aka netlabel), build a
random but unique self-referential and novel digital style, and
implement the organization of the label as a digital process
itself. Curiosly, the first version of the website was written in perl
using Ted Nelson's ZigZag(tm) structure as a backend database and
custom frontend code. In the second iteration, a LAMP implementation
of a similar mechanism was used, getting up to speed with developing
web technologies. It allowed online manipulation by editors directly
via the website, CMS and so, uuh!

All of this proved to be creatively fruitful and a lot of fun.
Economically it was not even unsuccessful due to our outright
art-pour-l'art approach, aka business naivity, but did not carry. The
label released about 50 packages of cutting edge audio-visual content
by an illustre set of both acclaimed and upcoming artists, united by
the their quest for truly innovative approach in media design,
technical and aesthetic identity. The discography includes two
tangible physical releases, each a CDROM sampling the catalogue at 25
(fb25) and 50 (fb50) releases.

fals.ch has been successfully reanimated from cryo sleep in or
about 2019. the domain is live again and points to a reconstruction of
the back catalogue. new release scheduled and upcoming.

#### Gullibloon

Picking up fm's obsession with sonification and real time data-driven
synthesis and composition approaches, Gullibloon was conceived as a
double identity of software project and music author, building all of
their pieces on real time data feeds collected from virtual and
physical sources. Tapping processes such as network traffic, computer
activity status, various sensors and algorithmic generators. They can
be found on the [web](https://gullibloon.org).

- Gullibloon 'MUH' (ALKU 87, 2010), Music cassette tape, grey and pink versions, sold out, <http://alkualkualkualkualkualkualkualkualkualku.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ALKU87>
- Army of Darkness, on [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7nEPDXEioM&t=28s), produced ca. 2010

#### Solo work

Been creating a dizzying amount of synthetic persona over time
including *Calimba de Luna*, *dprmkr*, *pxp* and *tsx*, to name just a
few. They are all listed in the data table at the top of the page.
