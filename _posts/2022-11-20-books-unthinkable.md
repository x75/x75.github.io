## Summary review

![image](/assets/unthinkable-cover.jpeg)

[Unthinkable](https://www.helenthomson.co.uk/) is a 2018 book by Helen
Thomson which looks at nine different people and their brains.

Human brains are not all alike, That much is clear to everyone. What
is less clear, is the sheer amount of how different they can actually
be. All the time still being OK brains, each, in the sense of that
they cope. People's body heights for example are also different, but
the amount they differ by is limited. There are no people that are
10cm or 3m in height. With brains, this is not so. While there is
something like roughly similar 'normal' brains for many people, there
are also wildly differing brains and there is hardly any limit on how
different from the majority any single brain can be.

As such, it is a story about diversity, and diversity in as extreme a
form as it possibly gets. It highlights nine individuals with very
specific and rare conditions affecting their brains, and thus, their
experience of themselves and the world. Tons of psychology and
neuroscience lessons for use in robotics included for free.

Conditions include 1/ not forgetting, 2/ loss of location, 3/
synaesthesia (auras), 4/ switching personalities, 5/ constant
hallucination (audio), 6/ becoming a tiger, 7/ becoming unreal, 8/
waking up dead, 9/ feeling other people's pain. For all the details I
refer you to the book itself. Instead, let's pick a few gems of
insight and narrative and comment on them.



### Selected and annotated quotes

Maybe it is still better to read a book on paper, make less highlights
and just have fewer problems?

> 85/86 synaesthesia, Vilayanur Ramachandran, round blob vs. jagged piece, naming them bouba vs kiki

In this experiment on synaesthesia the close relationship between
perception of shape and sound or language comes to the front. Love it.

> 96 the dress. a classical example. straightforward indication of two entirely equally valid modes of perception, prevalent in the population. Beside the two main modes, there is a few lower but equally stable side modes, too.

I have seen this come through back then but wasn't so impressed as
this time round. The picture is really very good and-just-works for
everyone I have shown it to. Myself I seem to be able to see both
black/blue and white/gold while others always see it in the same
colors.

> 143 David Rosenhan, 1973 experiment, schizophrenia psychiatry admission experiment

Even if the Rosenhan's rigor in that study is subject to veritable
criticism, the idea is interesting and it certainly just makes for a
great story.

> 145 Ganzfeld  technique sensory deprivation, ping pong balls on eyes and white noise on the headphones.

Very interesting sensory deprivation experimental technique. I have
heard about this one previously, have tried it once I think but found
it stupid at that time and didn't get good results because probably I
just was too impatient. Things to do.

> 146 Oliverc Sacks, the brain doesn't tolerate inactivity

Oliver Sacks is well known and just putting some more matter on the the sensory deprivation technique of creating hallucinations, this is a crisp way of putting it. If in a deprived state without any changes in stimulation, the brain amplifies its own random fluctuations into fully fledged but spurious experiences.

> 161 Schizophrenia is one of the most complex of human disorders affecting 1 in 100 persons.

Noteworthy phenomeno and noteworthy numbers. Given [Dunbar's number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunbar%27s_number) as a reference (probably suboptimal choice), that means each of us know's one and a half people affected by schizophrenia.

> 191-197 Interoception & all related

This is a bit terse. It highlights in detail the essential importance of interoception for a passable experience of self at all. Need to go back for details but don't have access to the book right now.

> 213 Seth, Chinese woman brain scan entire cerebellum is missing

This year I met a cat (Earl) that was said to have no cerebellum, and that cat was certainly moving in a weird way. It quite took me that there also is people with that condition, so I researched this particular fact. Also note the man with only 10% of his brain below.

> 218 default mode network

I just love the default mode network and note down every single reference I find to it. You should check out the default mode network if you haven't.

> 246 Compassion training to overcome empathy, willfully extend warm feelings towards everyone in the environment

Suffering from a bit of over-empathisizing usually I found it interesting to again learn about the distinction between compassion and empathy, and then, that you can train for compassion in favor of empathy.
