## Summary review

Book puts question about how humans became the dominating hominid
species over the last 300000 years. It puts forward the idea that this
is due to domestication, essentially selection by friendliness,
leading to skills of cooperative communication among humans, dogs,
and bonobos. Cooperative communication made _the_ decisive difference
between humans and the other hominids, which were just not as good at
it. That makes sense, work together to become much better as a group,
ultimately. But how did domestication come about if there was no one
around that would domesticate us? Central in this then is
self-domestication, which occured in humans, and also dogs and
bonobos, as is suggested.

Putting friendliness on the test stand, the book includes a section on
the psychology of groups and identity that outlines an analysis and
approach at how to bridge the mindset divide we experience locally and
globally. It connects incidentally quite well with Braving the
wilderness by Brene Brown which I reviewed here. Also, there was a
very good post by Cory Doctorow just very timely about "how minds
really change".

I think this is all very hot and interesting, despite criticism of the
self-domestication hypothesis.

To see why this is so, let's look at some of the details involved in
this bit of evolutionary trajectory, starting with eyes. It is only
humans and their domesticated animals which have white sclerae. White
what?!! Sclerae is the name for what is white in your eyes. If the
white stuff wouldn't be white, we wouldn't see the color of our
irises. Cool, no? Anyway, the white sclerae also allows us to see
where fellow humans are actually looking at. This is super essential
for intention recognition and thus cooperation, seeing what someone
else is going to do just by looking at their face. This ability cannot
be underestimated and can be tested for presence in animals by hiding
treats under one of two cups and giving a hint to where treat is
hidden just by looking at it. If the animal can use this cue, it will
find the treat more often on first trial rather than not. All other
animals have entirely dark eyes, and the reason is strategic. Most other
animals don't want you to be aware of where they are looking and what
they're going to do next. That's true even for their own social life
with their own kin. No friendliness there, really.

There is a hallmark experiment started by Dimitri Belyaev in the
former Soviet Union. It consisted in breeding foxes by selecting foxes
that are allowed to have offspring entirely by their
friendliness. Friendliness there is defined by having no fear of
interacting with humans. Turns out, 1/ this works really well and 2/
that by selecting for friendliness we also get a number of interesting
side effects, like nice & splotchy variations in fur patterns (which
provide less camouflage), curled up tails, smaller muzzles, smaller
brains, and voila, white sclerae.

Now the questions how this got bootstrapped. Even for dogs it is most
likely that some kind of self-domestication took place with wild
wolves before humans took up on breeding dogs. It happened simply by
the fact, that wolves who were more friendly, that is less afraid of
humans, would start to seek out human settlements foraging for food
more often than those wolves who were more afraid. This is the self-domestication
hypothesis is in action for wolves / dogs.

Dogs for example also coevolved the enzyme allowing humans to digest
and break down starch, which is a predicament to leverage the benefits
of agriculture. One of the underpinnings of current human
civilization. Either way, self-domestication hypothetically also took
place for humans starting something like 80000 years back
approximately, leading to the domesticated and friendly version of our
predecessors that we are.

One major corner stone of our social life theory of mind. Theory of
mind is a functional lump of brain activity which allows you to reason
about the activity of the other mind in the other person and what they
are up to. This is realized by the theory of mind circuit, a set of
functionally connected brain areas. My favorite feature of theory of
mind is so-called "false belief". This skill comes up in infant humans
around the age of four (check) and allows them (us) to understand that
someone else is mistaken. :shrug:

A lot more interesting things can be said about the theory of mind
circuit in our brain but here, let's take it to one particularly
relevant point.

Where does our ability to afflict mindless and utter industrialized
violence to other people come from if we are so friendly? It all
starts with the process of dehumanization. If we don't perceive the
other as human but rather as subhuman, none of our friendliness
criteria, empathy, and so forth apply. Dehumanization can easily be
identified in all populist rethoric, essentially along the lines of
"these animals on the other side ...". The thing is, if we perceive
someone, anyone, else, another fellow human, an animal or anything
alive, as subhuman, or theory of mind circuit goes blank (can be
measured), and then this is really bad. Because it remove all the
empathic barriers to our applied ethics and makes us as cruel as it
gets.

So here it also connects with Kate Darling's New breed and our
relation with animals and whether we dehumanize them or not and then
waht we are able to do to them.

Good. Thanks.

 - x self-domestication
 - x belyaev foxes experiment
 - x white sclerae and enabling to see where someone looks
 - x select for friendliness, domestication syndrome (splotchy fur, smaller muzzle, upcurled tail)
 - x link with evolutionary ancestors' or relatives' abilities and the stages of human development
 - x emotional reactivity, theory of mind, false belief is allows you to understand that someone esle is mistaken
 - x the theory of mind circuits, when they go blank it's bad, dehumanization, simianization
