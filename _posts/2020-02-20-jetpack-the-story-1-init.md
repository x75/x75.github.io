### Jetpack the Story, Part 1 Init

> summary

In July 2019 we founded Jetpack Cognition Lab, Inc.. This simple
statement betrays the fact that for us a decade of weaving a million
threads comes together as a single piece of rainbow for the first
time. Me and my cofounder Matthias Kubisch have come a long way to see
this happen. Unsurprising in retrospect it took some time to realize
the full impact of this particular step. This is the reason why I'm
six months late in writing this text.

> background

Both of us were starting a PhD in robotics in ca. 2012 at the
Department of Computer Science within the Humboldt-Universität zu
Berlin. There we got to know each other during undergraduate studies
earlier on. By now in 2020 both thesis projects are close to being
completed. When my employment at the university ended in 2017, before
the thesis was finished, it was already clear to us that we were going
to create a robotics company together as a post-doc thing. After a few
early experiments in the time since then we entered 2019 fully
committed to our own startup idea and were out to get some funding.

> tried to apply for EXIST stipend
 
In the German research ecosystem the EXIST grant is widely used as an
instrument to help scientists with that kind of ambition to transform
their research innovations into a business by funding three people
with a stipend for one year. We started out on that track and were
busy working on a proposal all through Q1/2019.

> microfunding

In the course of writing down our concept we were looking at small
funding tickets on the order of 20-50K already with interest. This is
an order of magnitude one can expect to receive from programs like
"Prototype Fund" or from any respectable crowdfunding campaign. It's
also a very friendly size psychologically.

Sometime during Jan/Feb 2019 we got in touch with Tosh from the
magic.do investment fund via our mutual connection and
lead-investor-to-be Oskar Obereder. It was introduced to us as a
microfund for tech- and AI-centered startups. At that time, we were
still fully committed to applying for EXIST and delayed our
negotiations so we wouldn't rule out any downstream options in
governmental funding programs by tainting the company with unapproved
investments. The plan was to keep the option open until EXIST would be
fixed.

> how we were lucky with our investors and private funding overtook EXIST

During May/June 2019 we met up several times with the funding
consortium. There was one meeting where we were getting infused by
Tosh on some general ideas sitting in front of a Kreuzberg Späti. A
few of these episodes lead up to our screening by Oskar and Wendelin
Weingartner in Feinkost Minutillo's Biergarten hosted by ACUD.  This
went reasonably well and we fixed the stakes. At the same time that we
were getting v/ positive feedback during these sessions we were
receiving very bad one from a pre-evaluation of our EXIST grant
application draft. At this point the decision announced itself.

End of part one.

### Jetpack the Story, Part 2 Founding mechanics

> ycombinator, standard documents, SAFE agreement

The magic crew introduced us to ycombinator and the startup-building
recipes they have come up. One of those is the consolidated process
for setting up a company (aka incorporating) with minimum
headache. The process emphasizes the use of standard documents that do
not have to be modified when going from one company to the next. A
central piece in this is the _Simple Agreement on Future Equity_
(SAFE), a **four-page** document that can be consumed and understood
by virtually anyone. In the SAFE a standard early-stage investment
deal is written down, requiring only a few variables to be filled in:
the name of the company, the name of the investor, and the number of
shares returned for what amount of investment.

Just to be clear about it, we're **not** associated with ycombinator
in any way but are adopting some of their processes and tools that are
publically available.

The Future bit in the SAFE takes care of the fact that all of this is
only relevant if and only if some kind of positive liquidation event
occurs during the time the SAFE is valid for. LE's can take on
new investment rounds, sell the company or close it down. Either
way, we took a SAFE and went with that.

> aka How to create a startup with Stripe Atlas in the US and run it in Germany

> stripe atlas, delaware c corp, ...

One of ycombinator's own startup children is the payment service
provider Stripe. They have a product called Atlas which takes the YC
standardization idea to an app level. The Atlas app allows you to
create your company by registering a Delaware LLC or C-Corporation and
open a workable bank account in the name of the newly founded
company.

In case you're a pure software business at this point you're probably
pretty much set. If you registered a corporation like we did, the
Atlas process involves a few more steps that you'll be churning down
in the weeks after the company initialization (for an LLC that's
probably true as well but I have not been there).

> company structure: shareholders, directors, officers

A corporation is a legal entity designed for fluid changes in
ownership of the company among a potentially large number of
parties. The standard document creates a stock of 10M shares
initially. These shares are Common Stock (CS) which means that they
come with a right to vote in a shareholder assembly. Another kind of
stock is a so called preferred stock (PS), which does not include the right
to vote.

The corporation, its structure and organs are defined by the bylaws
which are standardized and part of Atlas. At the top of the decision
chain are the shareholders with common stock. The shareholders then
name one or more directors into the Board of Directors, which in turn
may elect the company's officers (CEO, CFO, ETCTO, ..). In the case of
a two person founding team with a set of SAFEs you end up in all three
levels.

> issuing stock, 40/40, 20 pool

Founding the company does not make you the effective owner
automatically. For this to happen the company needs to issue the stock
to interested parties. In order to avoid paying a large income tax for
the non-liquid assets of the fledgling company, this needs to be done
within a month after registering the company, whereby they are
guaranteed to be valued by their par-value of something very
small. After signing the purchase agreement, one has to make sure to
actually pay this amount to your own company and make sure the
transaction is recorded in the logs.

The stock purchase agreement also comes with this process. The precise
allocation of shares depends on the number of founders and their
indivdual stakes of course. In addition, it is considered good practice
to leave a portion of shares unissued. These comprise a pool, which we can
use later on to give to the first few critical team members as an
incentive. After few discussions we went for a 40 /
40 / 20 split among founder / founder / pool.

> enter operations

Depending on your situation you will need to divert company money
towards yourself. Starting with a full-blown employment is maybe too
complicated in terms of admin overhead and also not so flexible. Based
on different advice from our network and beyond we picked the
two-freelancers-invoicing-to-company model. This means each founder
will invoice their services and expenses to the company every one or
two months, either in a direct way or as successive installments of an
a priori budget.

> enter Germany

What's special as an Atlas user for us is that we are operating out of
Germany. It is a great place in many ways but it is plagued by a
passion for regulation and a tendency for administrative
stiffness. The freelancer model sketched above is not a long-term
solution. Also, no self-respecting German authority or company will
really meet you on eye-level if you are a foreign company. No business
accounts with vendors, no bank accounts with German banks, no tax ID,
and so on. To make yourself economically domestic you have to have an
entry in the commercial registry (Handelsregister).

The standard advice in this case is to create a German subsidiary of
the foreign company, for example a GmbH which is like a Ltd. We did
not want to do this in the first place so that did not work for us.

> TODO: german commercial registry, certified copies, notaries, ...

Turns out there are simpler ways of achieving the same. The magic move
is to create a German branch of the company aka Zweigniederlassung. A
Zweigniederlassung can be registered with the German commerce
registry. This can be done by any notary and requires notarized true
copies of the original foreign registry entry.

While initially unclear how these can be obtained we found out just
this week that the process is called an apostille which exists by
decree from a 1961 Den Haag convention. For apostilles again, there
exists a large number of service providers many of which offer online
interfaces allowing you to click the required apostille service
including retrieval of the document, legalization (the actual
apostilling), and translation into the target language. Stay tuned for
updates, this is literally WIP for us.
