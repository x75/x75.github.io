### Jetpack the Story, Part 1 Init

> summary

In July 2019 a decade of weaving of threads came together as a single
piece when me and Matthias Kubisch founded Jetpack Cognition Lab,
Inc., a Berlin based robotics startup registered in Delaware in the
US. In other words, we have come a long way to see this
happen. Unsurprising in retrospect it still took some time for me to
realize the full impact of this inconspicuous little step. This is one
of the reasons why I'm lagging behind by months in documenting the
events leading up to and away from that day.

> background

Both of us were doing a PhD in robotics at the Department of Computer
Science within the Humboldt-Universität zu Berlin. There we got to
know each other years earlier during undergrad studies. When my
employment at the university ended in 2017, before the thesis was
finished, it was already clear to us that we were going to create a
robotics business together as the most attractive post-doc
perspective. After a few early experiments during those two years we
came into 2019 fully committed to building our own startup from
scratch and were out to get some funding.

> EXIST stipend
 
In the German research ecosystem the EXIST grant is a widely used
instrument to help scientists with that kind of ambition to transform
their research into an innovative business. It is a stipend that funds
a team of three people for one year. We started out on that track and
were busy working on a grant proposal all through Q1/2019.

> microfunding

In the course of writing up our concept we were looking at _small_
funding tickets on the order of 20-50K already with interest. This is
an order of magnitude one can expect to receive from programs like
"Prototype Fund" or from a respectable crowdfunding campaign. It's
also a very friendly size psychologically.

Sometime during Jan/Feb 2019 we got in touch with Tosh of the magic.do
investment fund via our mutual connection and lead-investor-to-be
Oskar Obereder. magic was introduced to us as a microfund for tech-
and AI-centered startups. At that time, we were still fully committed
to applying for EXIST and delayed our negotiations so we wouldn't rule
out any downstream options in governmental funding programs by
tainting the company with unapproved investments. The plan was to keep
the option open until EXIST would be fixed.

> how we were lucky with our investors and private funding overtook EXIST

During May/June 2019 we met up several times with the funding
consortium. There was one meeting where we were getting infused by
Tosh on some general ideas sitting in front of a Kreuzberg Späti. A
few of these episodes lead up to our screening by Oskar and Wendelin
Weingartner in Feinkost Minutillo's Biergarten in ACUD. This went
reasonably well and we fixed the stakes. At the same time that we were
getting v/ positive feedback during these sessions we were receiving
very bad one from a pre-evaluation of our EXIST grant application
draft. At this point the decision which way to go just announced
itself.

End of part one.
