### Jetpack the Story, Part 1 Init

This is the story of [Jetpack Cognition Lab](https://jetpack.cl),
creator of the [Bakiwi](https://bakiwi.shop) robot friend, and

> "the freshest and the bestest ever stepped on the scene"

of robotics startups and other lifestyle companies. The motivation to
write it up is to send a message to our past selves that would have
helped to get a clear picture quickly on several occasions. Maybe this
can be leveraged by other people too who are facing similar situations
now or in the future.

> intro

In July 2019 a decade of weaving threads came together as a single
piece when me and Matthias Kubisch founded the Berlin based robotics
startup Jetpack Cognition Lab, Inc. as a Delaware, US corporation. We
have come a long way to see this happen, and by overflow and inertia
it took quite some time for me personally to realize the full
importance of this formally inconspicuous step. The writing of the
story is usually lagging behind reality by a few months.

> our background

We got to know each other few years back during our undergraduate
studies. Later on both of us were pursuing a PhD in robotics at
Humboldt-Universität zu Berlin and we intensified our discourse. Faced
with economic necessities and career choices each one of us had
independently developed a favor for the entrepreneurial
path. Discussing that, it soon became clear that we were going to
create some kind of robotics business together as the most attractive
and even necessary perspective.

When my employment at HU ended in mid 2017, the pursuit of that idea
jumped to a new level of intensity. Over the next two years we did a
couple of experiments joining other startups to learn and try out some
ideas about business development we had come up with.

After a wild ride packed with lessons from mid to end of 2018 we came
into the new year fully committed and ballistic about building our own
company from scratch. Only then we were finally convinced that we
would easily be capable of running our own thing and in particular to
handle all the business aspects of it. Next, we were out to spec the
project and get us funded.

> EXIST stipend
 
In the German research ecosystem the [EXIST](https://www.exist.de)
grant is a popular instrument to help scientists with entrepreneurial
ambitions to transform their research into an innovation based
business. It is a stipend to fund a team of three people for one year
to develop an early business plan. We started out on that track and
were busy working on our concept and deriving a grant proposal from
that all through Q1/2019. As a team of two techies (at least on paper)
we quickly faced the issue of having to have a business head on the
team on order for the funding body to take our proposal serious.

> microfunding

In the course of writing up the concept we started to look at _small_
funding tickets on the order of 10-50K. Funding of this order of
magnitude can be received from several public initiates like the
Prototype Fund in Germany, or from a respectable crowdfunding
campaign. Microfunding can be observed as a larger trend in state of
the art innovation culture. The clear advantage of small tickets is
the large amount of psychological pressure it takes out for all
parties involved. This greatly accelerates decisions by raising the
confidence on the founder side and lower the risk on the investor
side.

Sometime between Jan and Feb 2019 we got in touch with Thomas Schranz
aka Tosh via our mutual connection and lead-investor-to-be Oskar
Obereder. At the time Tosh was working on the magic fund, which was
introduced to us as a microfund for technology and AI focussed
startups. We started to integrate the option but were still fully
committed to plan A, apply for the EXIST grant. We delayed our
negotiations so we wouldn't rule out downstream options in
governmental funding programs by tainting the company with wild
private investments. The plan was to keep the option open until the
stipend would be granted to us and only then pull the plug and move
forward.

> how we were lucky with our investors and private funding overtook EXIST

We met up a few times with the private funding consortium during May
and June 2019. Clearly remember one meeting where we ended up sitting
in front of a Kreuzberg Späti near U Schlesisches Tor, getting infused
by Tosh on most of the general ideas we later used to actually
initialize and build the company. These episodes lead up to our
screening by Oskar and Wendelin Weingartner in Feinkost Minutillo's
Biergarten in ACUD. The screening went reasonably well and we ended up
with a solid handshake agreement on the scope and stakes of the
project.

It was striking to get very positive feedback during these sessions
and to receive quite bad one from the pre-evaluations of our grant
application both at the same time. At this point we effortlessly made
the decision to swap our options and to pursue private equity
microfunding instead of the public program, simply for the pace and
simplicity at which decisions can be made.

The handshake agreement on funding and building Jetpack is where part
one ends. The story continues in [part
two](/2020/02/28/jetpack-the-story-2-make/) which contains the record
of the mechanics of incorporation and the first few steps after that.
In [part three](/2020/08/19/jetpack-the-story-3-enter-germany/) we
describe how the company was registered as a local business in
Germany.
