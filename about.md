#### about dynatropes and navigating option landscapes ✴️

This is the [dynatropes](https://dynatrop.es) blog run by Oswald
Berthold. Purpose is to document ongoing and historical research
activity and projects. WIP task is cleaning up and pulling in several
legacy sites from all over the the web.

Main current projects is my AI and Robotics startup [Jetpack Cognition
Lab](https://jetpack.cl) that I cofounded in 2019 with [Matthias
Kubisch](https://github.com/ku3i), my research and writing on [Robot
self-exploration and skill
acquisition](https://edoc.hu-berlin.de/handle/18452/22259) and the
behavioral science fallout on society, my music and audio work with
[farmersmanual](https://web.fm) and
[friends](https://farmersmanual.bandcamp.com/), plus random bits and
pieces as is the good style to create the unexpected.

Topics are AI, robots, music, art, philosophy, business, complexity,
biology, machine learning, see also the hyper-associative tag-cloud.
