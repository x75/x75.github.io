#### about dynatropes and navigating option landscapes ✴️

Thanks for dropping in on the [dynatropes](https://dynatrop.es)
blog. The site is in transition to become the Oswald Berthold landing
page. Cleaning up and pulling in several legacy sites strewn across
the web and better document historical and ongoing activity and
achievements. This is obviously work-in-progress (WIP).

The main projects I am working on right is the robotics startup
[Jetpack Cognition Lab, Inc.](https://jetpack.cl) I founded in 2019
with [Matthias Kubisch](https://github.com/ku3i), then my research and
writing on [Robot self-exploration and skill
acquisition](https://edoc.hu-berlin.de/handle/18452/22259) plus its
implications for a wide range of topics, and my music and audio
work with [farmersmanual](https://web.fm) and
[friends](https://farmersmanual.bandcamp.com/).

Topics are AI, robots, music, art, philosophy, business, complexity,
biology, see also tag-cloud. It got a bit bloated, sorry, also WIP.

Make sure to check me up on other sites with plenty of activity of
several profiles, for example the ones on
[Twitter](https://twitter.com/x7557x),
[Github](https://github.com/x75), and so on.
