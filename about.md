Thanks for dropping in on the dynatrop.es blog. The site is in
transition to become the Oswald Berthold landing page. Cleaning up and
pulling in several legacy sites strewn across the web and better
document historical and ongoing activity and achievements.

The main projects I am working on is my / our robotics startup
[Jetpack Cognition Lab, Inc.](https://jetpack.cl), my research and
writing on [Robot self-exploration and skill
acquisition](https://edoc.hu-berlin.de/handle/18452/22259), and my
music and audio related work with [farmersmanual](https://web.fm) and
others.

Topics are AI, robots, music, art, philosophy, business, complexity,
life, see also tag cloud below. It got a bit bloated, sorry (WIP).
