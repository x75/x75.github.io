#### about dynatropes and navigating option landscapes ✴️

This is the [dynatropes](https://dynatrop.es) blog run by Oswald
Berthold (he/him), an Austrian artist, computer scientist, and
entrepreneur. He has also been called a [Digital
musician](https://www.amazon.com/Digital-Musician-Andrew-Hugill-2007-10-26/dp/B01FEOFJM0),
an
[Artist-technologist](https://arttech.mason.digital/profile/oswald-berthold/),
and is working hard on the creation of new words for new things
[digitalia](https://chicagoreader.com/arts-culture/oswald-berthold/).

The purpose of the blog is to document Oswald's work, including ongoing
and historical research activity and projects. Everything is
work-in-progress, as of last update 2022-04-02.

The main current projects are the AI & Robotics startup [Jetpack Cognition
Lab](https://jetpack.cl) that he cofounded in 2019 with [Matthias
Kubisch](https://github.com/ku3i), then his research and writing aka
PhD thesis on [Robot self-exploration and skill
acquisition](https://edoc.hu-berlin.de/handle/18452/22259), the
psycho-social fallout of behavioral science, and then his music and
audio work with [farmersmanual](https://web.fm), 
[friends](https://farmersmanual.bandcamp.com/), plus random bits and
pieces as is the good style to effectively create the unexpected.

Topics you will find bubbling up range across AI, robots, music, art,
psychology, business philosophy, complexity, simplicity, biology,
machine learning, see also the hyper-associative tag-cloud.

Check up on any of these profiles as they
contain a lot of non-redundant information with respect to what is
presented here. You are invited to leave a like or post a comment if
anything is unclear.
