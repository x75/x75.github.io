psycho-social fallout of behavioral science, and then his music and
audio work with [farmersmanual](https://web.fm), 
[friends](https://farmersmanual.bandcamp.com/), plus random bits and
pieces as is the good style to create the unexpected.

Topics you will find are AI, robots, music, art, philosophy, business,
complexity, biology, machine learning, see also the hyper-associative
