> Oswald Berthold, a member of the Farmers Manual and also an entrepreneurial face. He is the founder and CEO of Jetpack Cognition Lab, a venture robotics company in Berlin. Here is a unique small robot equipped with a sensor developed and sold by Jetpack CL. Oswald is a versatile person üòÆ

The main current projects are the AI & Robotics startup [jetpack cognition
lab](https://jetpack.cl) that he cofounded in 2019 with [Matthias
Kubisch](https://github.com/ku3i), then his research and writing aka
PhD thesis on [Robot self-exploration and skill
acquisition](https://edoc.hu-berlin.de/handle/18452/22259), the
psycho-social fallout of behavioral science, and then his music and
audio work with [farmersmanual](https://web.fm), 
[friends](https://farmersmanual.bandcamp.com/), plus random bits and
pieces as is the good style to effectively create the unexpected.

Topics you will find bubbling up range across AI, robots, music, art,
psychology, business philosophy, complexity, simplicity, biology,
machine learning, see also the hyper-associative tag-cloud.
